<p>While descending from the west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, Simpson fell 150 feet into a crevasse. Amazingly he survived, but was badly injured and with nowhere to go, Simpson rappelled further down in what he calls â€œa form of suicide." However, instead of dying, he found a way out. He then crawled a distance of five miles over three days, to get back to base camp.</p>
<h2> <font size="+3"> Anatoli Boukreev </font> </h2>

<p>After successfully ascending and descending Everest, Antatoli Boukreev heard that another party that had gone up after him and gotten stuck in a storm. Instead of hoping they were okay, he climbed part of the way back up the mountain to save whoever he could find. While eight people died on Everest that night, Boukreev managed to find and save three others, even though it was almost negative 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with near zero visibility.</p>
<h2> <font size="+3"> Aron Ralston </font> </h2>

<p>If you've seen the movie, 127 Hours, then you are no doubt familiar with this story. Ralston became pinned between a boulder and a wall in a slot canyon in Utah. After five days, he amputated his own arm and was eventually rescued. Ralston obviously has a good sense of humor, as evidence by the title of his book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place.</p>
